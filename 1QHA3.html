And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in they did not find the body. While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel; and as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, 'Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen"' (Lk 24:1-5).  </p>

And suddenly a sound came from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, distributed and resting on each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance" (Acts 2:1-4).</p>

            <i>In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.<br>
            O God come to my aid;<br>
            O Lord, make haste to help me.<br>
            Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.<br>
            As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,<br>
            world without end. Amen.<br></i>
            <br>
            At the beginning of each decade, announce the "mystery" to be contemplated, for example, the first joyful mystery is "The Annunciation".<br>
            
            After a short pause for reflection, recite the "Our Father", ten "Hail Marys" and the "Glory be to the Father". <br>
            
            An invocation may be added after each decade.<br>
            
            At the end of the Rosary, the Litany or some other Marian prayer is recited.</p>
